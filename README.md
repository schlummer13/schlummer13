### Hey! I'm Florian Fenzl 👋

I'm a software developer from Germany. 🇩🇪

I currently live in Düsseldorf, Germany. 🇩🇪

I have been building APIs and tools for Machine Learning and data systems with different teams and organizations. 🌎

I created some Trader and Indicators and a bunch of other open source tools. 🚀

I like to build things with Deep Learning/Machine Learning, distributed systems, SQL and NoSQL databases, Docker, Python, TypeScript (and JavaScript), modern backend APIs, and modern frontend frameworks. 🤖
